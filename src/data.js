      "I approached this game with low expectations, thinking it would be nice to try out for the price. However, I was pleasantly suprised by the overall quality of the cards and the art. The game mechanics offer limitless playability without an overly complicated setup of redundant outcomes. Overall this is one of my favorite party games and is my first recommendation for fans fantasy/DnD that aren't ready to start their next campaign",
